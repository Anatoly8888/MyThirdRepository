(I just) died in your arms tonight
	
Oh i, i just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something i can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And i don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary it sits on the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me
could come to this

Oh i, i just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh i, i just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface i'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet,
but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cos i've been thrilled to fantasy one
too many times
